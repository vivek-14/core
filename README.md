#### Hello :wave:, My fellow devs.

I have created a Custome framework for PHP currently it is on the elementary level however I will try to add more features as I go. I made it open source so any new changes and suggestions are welcome here.

Currently, it is not much high profile however if you have ever worked with any PHP MVC framework I think you will understand directory flow easily.
Beginners will have to learn the core concepts of MVC though but I made it beginner friendly as much as I could.

Concepts I have tried Following in this Project

1. MVC pattern
2. S.O.L.I.D principals
3. Routing


# Features 
  ### 1. Routing
  ### 2. Sample Authentication
  ### 3. Sample Notes
  ### 4. MVC Structure
  ### 5. Middleware
  ### 6. Composer
  ### 7: HTML, Bootstrap CSS library
  
# Coming Soon
  ### 1. Basic migration support db schema. -> In progress
  ### 2. Basic seeding support. -> Still planning phase
  ### 3. Unit test support
  ### 4. Doctrine ORM support

  # Now how to run it in your local.
  Step 1. Download or clone the Repository.
  
  Step 2. Put it in your system anywhere you like. Not necessary to put in your Xampp, Wamm, or Mamp root.
  
  Step 3. Make sure your PHP or services are running in your system.
  
  Step 4. To run open CLI & Run PHP -S localhost(127.0.0.1):8000(ANY_PORT).
  
  Step 5. Make sure to change DB access credentials in Core/Database.php &  DB name in ./config.php.
